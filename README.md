# React Blog Website
It  is a React-based blog website that has been designed with a focus on providing an excellent user experience. To achieve this, the project uses several hooks, including React Router, UseLocation, UseNavigate, SearchParams hooks, and AppContext hooks.

React Router is a widely-used routing library that enables easy navigation within a single-page application. UseLocation and SearchParams hooks are utilized to provide advanced filtering and search functionality, allowing users to easily find relevant blog posts. The UseNavigate hook is used to create seamless page transitions, resulting in a more enjoyable user experience.

AppContext hook is used to manage global state data, allowing the website to operate more efficiently by reducing unnecessary re-renders. The website has been divided into several pages, each with a specific focus, to further enhance the user experience.
